    "First I created variables needed for keeping a running total, iterating through a loop, and prompting the user. Then I nested a whalrus while loop inside a regular while loop with count based comparison. The whalrus while loop is able to prompt and assign at the same time of a comparison being made and is less code overall when inspecting inputs from the user. Next, I get a total from the user input and increment by one for the outer while loop and print a running total. It's crutial to have the correct indentation when utilizing these tecniques. Finally I printed the total once more to signify the end of the program."

I made a travel variable to help keep track of the running distance traveled and set it equal to the miles per hour multiplied by the count variable which was incremented inside the while loop.
