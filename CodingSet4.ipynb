Then I nested a whalrus while loop inside a regular while loop with count based comparison. The whalrus while loop is able to prompt and assign at the same time of a comparison being made and is less code overall when inspecting inputs from the user. Next, I get a total from the user input and increment by one for the outer while loop and print a running total. It's crutial to have the correct indentation when utilizing these tecniques. Finally I printed the total once more to signify the end of the program."
